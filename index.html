            <p class="project-description">
                The Airplane Mode App is a comprehensive flight management system built using the Frappe Framework. 
                It enables airlines to manage flight schedules, bookings, and passenger details efficiently. The app 
                is designed with various features to streamline the process of organizing flights and keeping track of 
                vital flight information.

            <p class="project-description">
                I built a Rental Management System using the Frappe framework, where customers can book rides by specifying details like vehicle type, pickup date, time, and location. 
                The system records each booking in a Ride Order DocType, with three roles — Vehicle Manager, Vehicle Auditor, and Vehicle Supervisor — managing approvals based on role-specific permissions. 
                This project enhanced my skills in role-based access, DocType design, and user-friendly interface creation in Frappe.

                I developed a Hospital Appointment App using the Frappe framework. The app allows patients to apply for appointments and view available doctors' shifts at their preferred times.
                 It features user-friendly interfaces for booking appointments and managing schedules, along with appointment reminders and patient records. This project enhanced my web application
                  development skills and provided practical experience with Frappe's robust features for healthcare management.

                I built a Weather Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, I learned how to integrate APIs 
                to fetch real-time weather data and display it in a user-friendly way. I also developed my technical skills by 
                working with responsive design techniques, ensuring the app works smoothly across various devices. The project 
                helped me enhance my understanding of front-end development and improve my ability to create clean and functional user interfaces.</p>

            <p class="project-description">
                I built a Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project involved creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to
                 perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By developing this app, I enhanced my 
                 skills in DOM manipulation and event handling, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience. The project also deepened my understanding 
                 of JavaScript functions and logic, allowing me to create a fully functional and visually appealing calculator.

            <p class="project-description">
                I created a Quiz Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive application allows users to test their knowledge through a series of questions,
                 providing instant feedback on their answers. I designed an engaging user interface and implemented features such as score tracking and question navigation. 
                 Through this project, I improved my skills in front-end development, learned about form handling, and enhanced my understanding of JavaScript to manage the quiz logic effectively.

                <p>As the IT Coordinator at NavGurukul for six months, I was responsible for managing and maintaining the laptops across the campus. 
                    My role involved ensuring that every student had a properly functioning laptop along with a charger. I also maintained detailed
                     records of the laptop inventory, assigned devices, and resolved any technical issues related to the laptops. This role required 
                     strong time management and organizational skills, as I had to balance multiple responsibilities and ensure that all students had 
                     access to the necessary technology. Through this experience, I developed valuable problem-solving abilities and enhanced my capacity
                      for handling critical campus operations efficiently.
